## Introduction to Computer Vision

### Summary
This git repository contains assignments from EE 332 Intro to Computer Vision at Northwestern University. I completed this coursework as an 
elective during pursuit of my Masters of Science in Robotics.

## Description of Assignments
The assignments contained in this repository are commonly used computer vision techniques coded from scratch. Though rarely done in 
practical use, breaking down these techniques and re-creating them proved to be a great learning experience that greatly increased my 
computer vision understanding and application abilities.
